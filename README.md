# Aim Practice Game

This is a game built using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, with a Ruby on Rails API for the backend. The game allows a user to enter a username and then start a new game where they click on creepers to gain points and practice their aim for shooting video games. The program will keep track of their scores and will display their top 5 score to them in order.
